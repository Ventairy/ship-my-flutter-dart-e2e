# ship-my-flutter Dart E2E fixture

This disposable repository exercises the public Dart CLI and the thin GitHub
Action adapter against a real hosted repository.

It intentionally does not run the TestFlight candidate or App Store promotion
phases. No Apple credentials belong here.

The Ventairy organization locks the default workflow token to read-only, so the
fixture also exercises `github-token`, the documented GitHub App or narrowly
scoped PAT fallback. The test credential is stored only as an Actions secret.
